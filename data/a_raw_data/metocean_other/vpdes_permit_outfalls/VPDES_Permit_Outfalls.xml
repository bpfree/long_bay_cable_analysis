Discharge; Noncontact Cooling Water, Nonmetallic Mineral Mining; Petroleum and&#13;
Hydrostatic Test; Potable Water Treatment Plant, Seafood Processing; Stormwater&#13;

There is a single VPDES Individual Permit, but these are designated as&#13;
either Major or Minor permits depending on the amount of flow or if they&#13;
