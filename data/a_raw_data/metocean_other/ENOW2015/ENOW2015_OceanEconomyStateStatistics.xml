			<abstract>This dataset summarizes 2015 Ocean Economy employment statistics for the U.S. coastal states by breaking down each ocean economic indicator per each ocean sector. The dataset also provides percent employment and percent GDP by sector. This percentage is a percent of the ocean sector compared to the total Ocean Economy for each state. This information was harvested from the Economics: National Ocean Watch (ENOW) time-series data on the ocean and Great Lakes economy, derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. ENOW data measures four economic indicators: Establishments, Employment, Wages, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for six economic sectors that are dependent on the oceans and Great Lakes, including: Marine Construction, Living Resources, Offshore Mineral Extraction, Ship and Boat Building, Tourism and Recreation, and Marine Transportation.</abstract>
			<purpose>To support coastal and ocean planning and other activities pursuant to the Energy Policy Act, Coastal Zone Management Act, Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Rivers and Harbors Act and the Submerged Lands Act.</purpose>
			<supplinf>By law, non-zero values that cannot be published without violating the confidentiality of one or more businesses must be suppressed in published data, although they are reflected in higher level totals. Suppressed values are represented as "-9999" in ENOWâ€™s tabular data and are aggregated, where applicable, under the "Suppressed" sector. ENOW reports zero values to indicate economic activity of that type is not occurring, is undisclosed, or is otherwise not measured by the indicators.</supplinf>

						<edomv>Marine Construction</edomv>
						<edomvd>The marine construction sector accounts for the heavy construction activities associated with dredging of navigation channels, beach renourishment, and dock building. Although it would seem logical to include activities associated with the construction of oil and gas pipelines that directly support offshore oil and gas production, the underlying data are almost always suppressed because of the small number of businesses in any one area. In many cases, protecting the confidentiality of these businesses requires the suppression of the entire sector, including information for activities that could otherwise be reported. For this reason, these activities are not included in ENOWâ€™s data on the Ocean Economy. The effect of this omission is most prominent in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska.</edomvd>

				<attrdomv>
					<edom>
						<edomv>Living Resources</edomv>

					</edom>
				</attrdomv>
				<attrdomv>
					<edom>
						<edomv>OffShore Mineral Extraction</edomv>
						<edomvd>Offshore mineral extraction includes oil and gas exploration and production, as well as limestone, sand, and gravel mining in the coastal and marine environment. The largest component of this sector is oil and gas production, which is concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico region.</edomvd>

					</edom>
				</attrdomv>
				<attrdomv>
					<edom>
						<edomv>Ship and Boat Building</edomv>
						<edomvd>This sector includes the construction, maintenance, and repair of ships, recreational boats, commercial fishing vessels, ferries, and other marine vessels. An important attribute of this sector is the concentration of large shipyards in a few locations around the country. However, boat building and repair activity is spread more evenly around the country, with concentrations in areas with high levels of commercial fishing and recreational boating.</edomvd>

				<attrdomv>
					<edom>
						<edomv>Tourism and Recreation</edomv>
						<edomvd>The tourism and recreation sector has more business establishments and employs more people than all the other five sectors combined, but only accounts for about a third of the Ocean Economyâ€™s gross domestic product. This sector includes a wide range of businesses that attract or support ocean-based tourism and recreation: eating and drinking places, hotels and lodging, scenic water tours, aquariums, parks, marinas, boat dealers, recreational vehicle parks and campsites, and associated sporting goods manufacturing.</edomvd>

				</attrdomv>
				<attrdomv>
					<edom>
						<edomv>Marine Transportation</edomv>
						<edomvd>This sector includes businesses engaged in the traffic of deep-sea freight, marine passenger services, pipeline transportation, marine transportation services, warehousing, and the manufacture of navigation equipment. It accounted for 14.3 percent of the employment and 20.6 percent of the gross domestic product in the U.S. ocean and Great Lakes economy. While the sector represents a smaller percentage of the Ocean Economy than tourism and recreation or offshore mineral extraction, it is an integral component of the Ocean Economy, paying one of the highest average wages per employee.</edomvd>
