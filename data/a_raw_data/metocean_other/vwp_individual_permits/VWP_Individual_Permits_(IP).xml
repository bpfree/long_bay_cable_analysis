            <abstract>The Virginia Water Protection Program (VWP) regulates activities in all surface waters which includes wetlands, streams, and open water. A permit (general permit coverage or individual permit) may be required in accordance with program regulations and State Water Control Law. This layer represents the project location of both active and historic VWP Individual Permits (IP) issued across the state. The Individual Permit's number, name, and regional office are among several attributes in this layer. The attribute data is pulled from DEQ's Comprehensive Environmental Data System (CEDS). The GIS data layers and maps produced by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) are provided as a public resource. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality has attempted to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data.
