SAB_mobile_freq:  U.S. Geological Survey calculated recurrence interval of sediment mobility at select points in the South Atlantic Bight for May 2010 to May 2011 (Geographic, WGS 84)

<dt><em>Abstract:</em>  
<dd>

The U.S. Geological Survey has been characterizing the regional variation in shear stress on the sea floor and sediment mobility through statistical descriptors.  The purpose of this project is to identify patterns in stress in order to inform habitat delineation or decisions for anthropogenic use of the continental shelf.  The statistical characterization spans the continental shelf from the coast to approximately 120 m water depth, at approximately 5 km resolution.  Time-series of wave and circulation are created using numerical models, and near-bottom output of steady and oscillatory velocities and an estimate of bottom roughness are used to calculate a time-series of bottom shear stress at 1-hour intervals.  Statistical descriptions such as the median and 95th percentile, which are the output included with this database, are then calculated to create a two-dimensional picture of the regional patterns in shear stress.  In addition, time-series of stress are compared to critical stress values at select points calculated from observed surface sediment texture data to determine estimates of sea floor mobility.

</dd>
<dt><em>Supplemental_Information:</em>  
<dd>

This data layer is a subset of the U.S. Geological Survey Sea Floor Stress and Sediment Mobility database, and contains the recurrence interval of sediment mobility at select points in the South Atlantic Bight.  Gridded stress value (found in other layers) are calculated by interpolating wave model results to the current model grid, which may result in some water grid cells from the current model being removed and not included with the output polygons if they partially overlap land cells in the wave model.  Sediment mobility statistics (such as recurrence interval) are calculated using wave and current model results at the location of the sample, therefore it is possible in some cases for a sediment mobility statistic to be calculated although it lies within a polygon with no output value, because that specific location may be within a water cell in both models while the containing current grid cell overlaps land in the wave model elsewhere in the cell.

<h3><A NAME="why">Why was the data set created?</A></h3>
<blockquote>
This GIS layer contains an estimate of the recurrence interval of sediment mobility at select points in the South Atlantic Bight.  This output is based on numerical models of wave and circulation used to estimate bottom shear stress over an approximately one year time frame, which is subsequently compared to critical stress values estimated from observed surface sediment texture data.  This data layer is primarily intended to show the overall distribution of sediment mobility on large spatial scales, and should be used qualitatively.  Intended users include scientific researchers and the coastal and marine spatial planning community.

The North Carolina State University (NCSU) SABGOM model was used to provide estimates of near-bed current velocity used for calculating the time-series of bottom shear stress.
<P>
The SABGOM hydrodynamic model (<A HREF="http://omglnx6.meas.ncsu.edu/sabgom_nfcast/">&lt;http://omglnx6.meas.ncsu.edu/sabgom_nfcast/&gt;</A>) is operated by North Carolina State University as a quasi-operational nowcast/forecast system in the Southeast Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association (SECOORA, <A HREF="http://secoora.org/">&lt;http://secoora.org/&gt;</A>), part of the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (<A HREF="http://www.ioos.noaa.gov">&lt;http://www.ioos.noaa.gov&gt;</A>). The underlying circulation model is the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS; <A HREF="http://www.myroms.org">&lt;http://www.myroms.org&gt;</A>), a finite-difference, hydrostatic, primitive equation ocean model that solves for the free surface elevation and three dimensional flow patterns, temperature, and salinity. 
<P>
The SABGOM configuration of ROMS has 5 km horizontal resolution and 36 layers in vertical terrain-following coordinates. Ocean open boundary values are from a global forecast that uses the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HyCOM) with assimilation of satellite and in situ data with the Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation (NCODA) system. Tidal harmonic boundary variability is determined from a regional tidal model.
<P>
The datafiles for the time period used in this analysis were acquired directly from Dr. Ruoying He of NCSU.

The WavewatchIII (WW3) numerical wave model (v3.14) was run on both a global 30' and regional North Atlantic 10' grid. The global grid is identical to the one used by the NOAA WW3 forecast system, whereas the regional grid is based on the NOAA WW3 grid but was modified slightly to remove parts of the &quot;do not compute&quot; mask at the outer boundaries where output was needed to pass to the nested, higher resolution grid.  WW3 is a 3rd generation phase-averaged numerical wave model which conserves wave energy subject to generation, dissipation, and transformation processes and resolves spectral energy density over a range of user-specified frequencies and directions.  The model was identically configured to the multi-grid system set-up used by the NOAA WW3 operational forecast (more information at <A HREF="http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/waves/index2.shtml">&lt;http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/waves/index2.shtml&gt;</A>), and was rerun purely to generate full spectra boundary conditions at the boundaries of the higher resolution nested domain.  Wind forcing was provided at 3-hour resolution from the NOAA North American Mesoscale (NAM) model (12 km resolution) over its domain, with the rest of the domain (outside the NAM grid) provided by the NOAA Global Forecasting System (GFS) model at 0.5 degree resolution.

The Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) numerical wave model (version 40.81, modified for proper calculation of RMS bottom orbital velocity and for output of bottom wave direction) was used to create a time-series of bottom orbital velocity, bottom representative period, and bottom wave direction over the one year time period of May, 2010 - May, 2011 in each grid cell in the model domain.  The wave model SWAN is a 3rd generation phase-averaged numerical wave model which conserves wave energy subject to generation, dissipation, and transformation processes and resolves spectral energy density over a range of user-specified frequencies and directions.  Although stress calculations were only performed over the spatial extent of the hydrodynamic model, SWAN was run over a larger spatial scale. The model domain consists of seven overlapping regular numerical model grids that follow the eastern and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States at approximately 3.5 km resolution.   The model was run for April 2010 using the default SWAN initial condition formulation for a non-stationary run, e.g., a JONSWAP spectrum from prescribed initial wind conditions, to develop initial conditions for the one year study period (May 2010 to May 2011).
<P>
Full spectra boundary conditions at each model ocean boundary point are interpolated from the output of the regional 10' Wavewatch III model, updated every hour.  Wind forcing was provided at 3-hour resolution from the NOAA North American Mesoscale (NAM) model (12 km resolution) over its domain, with forcing at the most offshore portions of the grid (outside the NAM grid) provided by the NOAA Global Forecasting System (GFS) model at 0.5 degree resolution.  The SWAN directional resolution was 6 degrees (60 bins), determined via sensitivity analysis as the coarsest (and hence least computationally expensive) resolution that does not result in the &quot;Garden-Sprinkler Effect&quot; (GSE), wherein swell traveling over large distances inaccurately disintegrates into non-continuous wave fields as a result of frequency and directional discretization.  The minimum frequency bin should be set to a value less than 0.7 times the lowest expected peak frequency and the maximum frequency bin should be set at least 2.5-3 times the highest expected peak frequency expected.  In order to determine appropriate values, the peak periods from 43 NDBC buoys throughout the wave model domain were analyzed (when available) over the one year period of the study, yielding 297,533 hourly observations.   The 99th and 1st percentiles of peak period were 15 s and 3 s, corresponding to frequencies of 0.07 Hz and 0.33 Hz, noting that these values may be biased by buoy limits of detection at high and low frequencies. The frequency range was therefore specified as 0.04-1 Hz.  SWAN was allowed to internally determine the frequency resolution as one tenth of each frequency bin for best performance of the discrete interaction approximation (DIA) method of nonlinear 4-wave interactions, resulting in 34 frequency bins.  Bottom friction calculations used the Madsen formulation with a uniform roughness length scale of 0.05 m.  This value was selected for the best comparison of model output and buoy observations within the domain, and does not correspond to physical roughness values or the bottom roughness used in stress calculations.  Wind generation and whitecapping parameterizations follow the modified Komen approach prescribed by Rogers et al. (2003), which reduces inaccurate attenuation of swell energy by whitecapping.  Wave model outputs of bottom orbital velocity, bottom representative period, and bottom wave direction were output hourly and interpolated onto the SABGOM model grid.

Use observed surficial sediment texture data to estimate the critical shear stress at those points where sediment texture data are available.  Calculations are performed in Mathworks MATLAB (v2011A).  The texture data includes the distribution of sediment over grain size classes ranging from -5 to 11 phi, ranging from gravel through sand and silt to clay.  Texture observations are first classified as cohesive or non-cohesive based on the fraction of clay: if the clay fraction exceeds 7.5%, the sample is deemed cohesive, if less than or equal to 7.5% the sample is non-cohesive.   Critical stress thresholds for non-cohesive sediment mixtures are calculated from the median grain size following Soulsby (1997).  Because a variety of unavailable parameters influence the critical shear stress for cohesive sediments, a value of 0.1 Pa is used for all samples identified as cohesive.  Although the density of sediment in the South Atlantic Bight can vary, analysis determined that the resultant variability in critical stress is small compared to the influence of particle size, and an assumed density value of 2650 kg/m3 (quartz) was used to allow inclusion of samples lacking composition information.  Critical stress values, median grain sizes, and classifications as cohesive or non-cohesive at each location are saved in MATLAB .mat format.  Additional information may be found in Dalyander et al. (2012).

Use the wave model and current model results to calculate the time series of bottom shear stress at each point for which sediment texture data are available using Mathworks MATLAB software (v2011A). Bottom shear stress estimates are made following Grant-Madsen (GM) (Madsen, 1994), from the estimated bottom orbital velocities and bottom wave periods generated with SWAN, and near-bed current estimates from the ESPreSSO hydrodynamic model.  The GM approach relies on an eddy viscosity turbulence closure model and formulates the wave stress, current stress, and combined wave-current bottom stress as functions of a representative bottom wave orbital velocity, representative bottom wave period, current flow at some reference height, the angle between wave and current propagation, and bottom roughness.  Full details of the GM formulation may be found elsewhere (Glenn, 1983; Glenn and Grant, 1987; Grant and Madsen, 1979, 1982, 1986; Madsen, 1994; Madsen et al., 1988).    
<P>
Wave direction, bottom orbital velocities, and bottom periods are calculated internally by the wave model.  Near-bed current magnitude and direction are taken from the hydrodynamic model, with the reference height taken as the distance from the cell vertical midpoint to the seabed.  GM requires that the current velocity be taken above the wave boundary layer (WBL) but within the log-profile current velocity layer.  If the thickness of the WBL calculated using GM exceeds of one or more of the deepest grid cells, the current estimate and associated reference height are used from the deepest grid cell at each location where the reference height exceeds the width of the WBL.  An estimate must be used for the maximum reference height where the log-profile velocity layer assumption is valid.  As discussed in Grant and Madsen (1986), the thickness of the log-profile layer based on laboratory experiments is approximately 10% of the current boundary layer thickness (Clauser, 1956). Because tidal currents, storm currents, and mean flow have a boundary layer thickness on the order of magnitude 10's of meters (Goud, 1987), a maximum value for reference height is set as 5 m.  
<P>
The GM bottom boundary layer model also requires a value for bottom roughness.  For the mobility estimates, it is the skin friction acting on the particles, and not the total bottom shear stress, which is the relevant parameter.  For that reason, observed sediment texture data from the USGS East Coast Sediment Texture Database (v2.2) are used to calculate the bottom roughness at each point for which they are available.  For non-cohesive samples (see definition in Process Step 2), the median grain size is used as the roughness.  For cohesive samples a roughness of 62.5 micrometers, which has a critical stress based on Soulsby (1997) of 0.1 Pa, is used.

Calculate the recurrence interval of sediment mobility by year and season in Mathworks MATLAB software (v2011A) by comparing the critical stress value at each point location where sediment texture data are available to the time series of combined wave-current stress at that location.  A bed mobility event was identified by exceedance of the critical stress threshold for at least 2 hours, with no minimum separation time between events. The recurrence interval is calculated as the length of the time period (in days) of interest (e.g., year or season) divided by the number of events during that time period.  These values are saved in MATLAB .mat format.

Export the point values from MATLAB format into an ArcGIS shapefile using the Mathworks MATLAB Mapping Toolbox (v2011A).  In some cases, data may exist during parts of the year and not others (for example, if no events are observed in a particular time period, resulting in a non-realistic recurrence interval of infinity); in this case, the statistic is calculated and included for the season where model output exist, and a missing data value of -9999 is used for seasons where no valid statistic can be calculated.  A geographic data structure is created in MATLAB with the following fields:  Geometry ('Point'), Lon (the longitude at the point), Lat (the latitude at the point), Winter (the statistic calculated for December, January, and February), Spring (the statistic calculated for March, April, and May), Summer (the statistic calculated for June, July, and August), and Fall (the statistic calculated for September, October, and November).  The shapefile is then written with the &quot;shapewrite&quot; command.  Because MATLAB does not assign a projection, the projection corresponding to the projection associated with the bathymetry used in the numerical models is added in ArcCatalog 9.3.  The file was then quality checked in ArcMap to insure values were properly exported to the shapefile from MATLAB.

Each attribute in this data layer covers a specific time period of interest.  The attributes include winter (December - February), spring (March - May), summer (June - August), fall (September - November), and the entire year.  Each of these attributes was calculated from model output spanning May, 2010 to May, 2011.  Statistical values will vary somewhat if calculated from model parameters covering a different time period, or if a different numerical model is used to estimate the time-series of waves and circulation used in calculating the time-series of bottom shear stress.  Critical stress values are based on estimates made from observed surface sediment texture data, and would vary somewhat if different texture data and/or a different model of critical shear stress calculation was used.
<p>
<li><A NAME="quality.2"><b>How accurate are the geographic locations?</b></A><p>
Numerical models are used in the generation of time-series of bottom shear stress used in creating this data layer.  Because the overall horizontal accuracy of the data set depends on the accuracy of the model, the underlying bathymetry, and forcing values used, and so forth, the spatial accuracy of this data layer cannot be meaningfully quantified.  These maps are intended to provide a qualitative and relative regional assessment of sea floor mobility at select points; users are advised not to use the data set to estimate mobility quantitatively at any specific geographic location, or to extrapolate mobility estimates to points not included in the database.

<li><A NAME="quality.3"><b>How accurate are the heights or depths?</b></A><p>
<p>
<li><A NAME="quality.4"><b>Where are the gaps in the data?  What is missing?</b></A><p>
All model output values were used in the calculation of this statistic.  The statistic was calculated for the date range of May, 2010 to May, 2011, and would potentially vary somewhat if performed on a different time period.  The underlying time-series of bottom shear stress was calculated from wave and current estimates generated with numerical models, and would vary if different models are used or if different model inputs (such as bathymetry or forcing winds) or parameterizations were chosen. Critical shear stress values used to estimate sediment mobility are based on observed surface sediment texture data, and mobility results would vary if different sediment texture data and/or a different model of critical shear stress were used.
