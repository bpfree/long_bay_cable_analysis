    "# Clip indicators and make extent smaller for zonation subregion runs\n",
    "\n",
    "This code was used to clip the indicators for each zonation subregion. This was necessary because the entire Southeast region is too large. When we were working in just the South Atlantic, we could input all the full indicator layers, and use a subregion mask to mask down. But for the full Southeast, this is too big and zonation can't run. This code is used to both mask the indicators and make the extent match the subregion extent, so that zonation can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "It puts the outputs in the same directory as the inputs, but they will have names that start with A_ plus the subregion name so you can tell them apart. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an output has the same values as the input (usually ranging from 1 - 10ish), then there is overlap and the indicator should be used. If the output has a werid high max value (the value of NODATA in the input indicator, sometimes 65535 because some inputs were 16 bit unsigned) you know it doesn't overlap with this subregion."
