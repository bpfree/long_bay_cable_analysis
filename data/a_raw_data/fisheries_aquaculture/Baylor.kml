<b>Public Grounds</b><br />
<p>Public Grounds are shellfish grounds set aside for public use and are not leasable.  Most public ground is not open to shellfish harvest; please refer to the map layer labeled Open Harvest Areas for open areas within public grounds and/or vacant grounds, and more importantly refer to <a href='http://mrc.virginia.gov/Regulations/FR720.shtm' target='_blank'>Regulation 4 VAC 20-720</a> for rules related to shellfish harvest including seasons, gear restrictions, daily harvest limits, etc.</p>

<b>Public Grounds</b><br />
<p>Public Grounds are shellfish grounds set aside for public use and are not leasable.  Most public ground is not open to shellfish harvest; please refer to the map layer labeled Open Harvest Areas for open areas within public grounds and/or vacant grounds, and more importantly refer to <a href='http://mrc.virginia.gov/Regulations/FR720.shtm' target='_blank'>Regulation 4 VAC 20-720</a> for rules related to shellfish harvest including seasons, gear restrictions, daily harvest limits, etc.</p>

<b>Public Grounds</b><br />
<p>Public Grounds are shellfish grounds set aside for public use and are not leasable.  Most public ground is not open to shellfish harvest; please refer to the map layer labeled Open Harvest Areas for open areas within public grounds and/or vacant grounds, and more importantly refer to <a href='http://mrc.virginia.gov/Regulations/FR720.shtm' target='_blank'>Regulation 4 VAC 20-720</a> for rules related to shellfish harvest including seasons, gear restrictions, daily harvest limits, etc.</p>

<b>Public Grounds</b><br />
<p>Public Grounds are shellfish grounds set aside for public use and are not leasable.  Most public ground is not open to shellfish harvest; please refer to the map layer labeled Open Harvest Areas for open areas within public grounds and/or vacant grounds, and more importantly refer to <a href='http://mrc.virginia.gov/Regulations/FR720.shtm' target='_blank'>Regulation 4 VAC 20-720</a> for rules related to shellfish harvest including seasons, gear restrictions, daily harvest limits, etc.</p>

<b>Public Grounds</b><br />
<p>Public Grounds are shellfish grounds set aside for public use and are not leasable.  Most public ground is not open to shellfish harvest; please refer to the map layer labeled Open Harvest Areas for open areas within public grounds and/or vacant grounds, and more importantly refer to <a href='http://mrc.virginia.gov/Regulations/FR720.shtm' target='_blank'>Regulation 4 VAC 20-720</a> for rules related to shellfish harvest including seasons, gear restrictions, daily harvest limits, etc.</p>

<b>Public Grounds</b><br />
<p>Public Grounds are shellfish grounds set aside for public use and are not leasable.  Most public ground is not open to shellfish harvest; please refer to the map layer labeled Open Harvest Areas for open areas within public grounds and/or vacant grounds, and more importantly refer to <a href='http://mrc.virginia.gov/Regulations/FR720.shtm' target='_blank'>Regulation 4 VAC 20-720</a> for rules related to shellfish harvest including seasons, gear restrictions, daily harvest limits, etc.</p>

<b>Public Grounds</b><br />
<p>Public Grounds are shellfish grounds set aside for public use and are not leasable.  Most public ground is not open to shellfish harvest; please refer to the map layer labeled Open Harvest Areas for open areas within public grounds and/or vacant grounds, and more importantly refer to <a href='http://mrc.virginia.gov/Regulations/FR720.shtm' target='_blank'>Regulation 4 VAC 20-720</a> for rules related to shellfish harvest including seasons, gear restrictions, daily harvest limits, etc.</p>

<b>Public Grounds</b><br />
<p>Public Grounds are shellfish grounds set aside for public use and are not leasable.  Most public ground is not open to shellfish harvest; please refer to the map layer labeled Open Harvest Areas for open areas within public grounds and/or vacant grounds, and more importantly refer to <a href='http://mrc.virginia.gov/Regulations/FR720.shtm' target='_blank'>Regulation 4 VAC 20-720</a> for rules related to shellfish harvest including seasons, gear restrictions, daily harvest limits, etc.</p>

<b>Public Grounds</b><br />
<p>Public Grounds are shellfish grounds set aside for public use and are not leasable.  Most public ground is not open to shellfish harvest; please refer to the map layer labeled Open Harvest Areas for open areas within public grounds and/or vacant grounds, and more importantly refer to <a href='http://mrc.virginia.gov/Regulations/FR720.shtm' target='_blank'>Regulation 4 VAC 20-720</a> for rules related to shellfish harvest including seasons, gear restrictions, daily harvest limits, etc.</p>
