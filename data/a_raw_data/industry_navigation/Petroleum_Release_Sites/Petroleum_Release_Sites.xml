            <abstract>The Virginia DEQ Petroleum Storage Tank Program provides various customer services to the Virginia community and other interested parties graphical information for petroleum release sites. Leaks and/or spills of petroleum and/or regulated substances into the environment are reported to DEQ. After a release is reported, DEQ staff work with the tank owner/operator to characterize and clean up the release. The GIS layer shows confirmed petroleum releases reported to DEQ.</abstract>
